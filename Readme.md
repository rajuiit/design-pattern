# Design Pattern Coding

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in Python. Each pattern is implemented in a separate Python script, demonstrating its use case and functionality.

## Design Patterns Implemented

* **Adapter Pattern** (`adapter.py`): Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
* **Decorator Pattern** (`decorator.py`): Enhances functionality of objects dynamically.
* **Facade Pattern** (`facade.py`): Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
* **Factory Pattern** (`factory.py`): Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
* **Middleware Pattern** (`middleware.py`): Intercepts requests and responses in a pipeline.
* **Observer Pattern** (`observer.py`): Implements a publish-subscribe mechanism.
* **Prototype Pattern** (`prototype.py`): Creates new objects by copying an existing instance.
* **Proxy Pattern** (`proxy.py`): Controls access to another object.
* **Singleton Pattern** (`singleton.py`): Ensures a class has only one instance.
* **Strategy Pattern** (`strategy.py`): Enables interchangeable algorithms at runtime.

## Getting Started

To use these design patterns in your project:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd design-pattern-coding
   ```
2. Run any script to see the design pattern in action:
   ```sh
   python adapter.py
   ```
